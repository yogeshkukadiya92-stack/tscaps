 * What can be done with one stored cut.

 * A cut is as wide as it is long, so it is narrower than any control at
 * a tenth of a second and wider than the panel at half a minute. A
 * floating menu survives both, because it takes the size it needs and
 * is pushed back inside the viewport on its own.
 *
 * It opens at the point that was pressed rather than at the mask's own
 * edge. Those are the same place on a button and a whole row apart on a
 * cut that fills one, and a menu that lands at the far end of the row
 * from the pointer is a menu the user has to go and find.
