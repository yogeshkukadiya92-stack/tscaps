/**
 * Covers the preview while the moment on screen is one the detector
 * has not measured yet.
 *
 * The blur is the point, not decoration: an unmeasured frame is not a
 * finished one, and showing it sharp invites it to be read as the
 * final look — which it may not be, since the effect can still lift
 * the caption once the measurement lands. Veiling it says "not yet"
 * where an un-lifted caption would have said "no".
 *
 * It also swallows pointer events, so a click meant for play does not
 * reach the video underneath while it is being held. Only pointer
 * events: the veil is a status readout rather than a control, so it
 * takes no focus and leaves the timeline and the transcript reachable
 * — someone who does not want to wait here can always move somewhere
 * else.
