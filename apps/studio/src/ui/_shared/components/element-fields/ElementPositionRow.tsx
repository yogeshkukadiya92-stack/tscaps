 *
 * All four, because a slider value is only a place while the anchor it
 * was read against holds still, and that anchor is free to move
 * afterwards — which covers the unmoved axis as much as the moved one,
 * and the anchors as much as the offsets. Or none, when the result
 * matches the inherited position: a placement that changes nothing
 * should not exist.
 *
 * `baseline` has to be a complete position in screen terms, so the
 * number a slider shows is the number a commit stores.
